# Legacy VHS Demos

**Note:** These VHS tape files (`.tape`) are legacy demos from early development.

**Current demos** are in the `assets/` directory as GIF files, recorded with OBS Studio for better quality and emoji/icon support.

## Files in this directory

- `*.tape` - VHS recording scripts (legacy)
- `generate-all.sh` - Batch generator for VHS demos
- Various markdown guides for VHS workflow

## Why replaced?

VHS demos rendered emojis and Nerd Font icons as boxes, making them unusable for showcasing TFE's visual features. OBS Studio recordings perfectly capture the terminal appearance.

See `demo-content/` for current recording scripts and tools.
