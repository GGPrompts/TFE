### Changed
- **Tree View Now Default Display Mode**

  - Users can still switch modes with F9 or number keys (1-4)
  - File modified: `model.go`
- **Dynamic Filename Truncation in Tree View**

  - Calculates width dynamically based on terminal size and view mode
  - Accounts for indentation, tree characters, icons, and favorites
  - Min: 20 chars, Max: 100 chars for optimal readability
  - Works correctly in both single-pane and dual-pane modes
  - File modified: `render_file_list.go`

### Fixed

  - Clicks now register accurately on the intended item/location
  - Files modified: `update_mouse.go`
- **Terminal State After External TUI Apps**
  - Fixed mouse input not working after exiting external TUI applications
  - Issue: Terminal state (including mouse mode) not properly restored
  - Solution: Use `tea.Sequence(tea.ClearScreen, tea.ExecProcess(...))` pattern
  - Ensures proper cleanup and state restoration
  - File modified: `update_mouse.go`
- **Fuzzy Search UI Interference**
  - Fixed background UI scrolling/updating during fuzzy search
  - Fixed typing lag and missing keystrokes in fuzzy search
  - Fixed filter results flickering through background UI
  - Solution: Block all keyboard/mouse events when `fuzzySearchActive` is true
  - Files modified: `update_keyboard.go`, `update_mouse.go`, `view.go`
- **Command Line Paste Bug:** Fixed brackets appearing around pasted text
  - Root cause: Using `msg.String()` which wraps paste events in brackets by design
  - Solution: Use `msg.Runes` to get raw text (Bubble Tea handles escape sequences)
  - Removed unnecessary helper functions (`cleanBracketedPaste`, `isBracketedPasteMarker`)
  - Fixed in: command prompt input, dialog input, and command continuation
  - Credit: Analysis by OpenAI Codex
- **Command Line Input:** Removed 's' key hotkey to allow typing 's' in command prompt
  - 's' key was intercepting command input before reaching the prompt
  - To toggle favorites, use F2 (context menu) or right-click ‚Üí "‚òÜ Add Favorite"
  - Prioritizes command typing over single-letter shortcuts

### To Be Implemented
- Search/filter functionality within directories
- Multi-select and bulk operations
- Menu bar with dropdowns (File/View/Tools/Help)
- Splash screen on launch
