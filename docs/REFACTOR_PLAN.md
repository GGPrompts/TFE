# TFE Refactoring Plan

## ✅ COMPLETED - 2025-10-15

This refactoring has been successfully completed! The original 1668-line `main.go` has been split into 10 modular files totaling 1743 lines.

## Original Status

`main.go` had grown to **1668 lines**. Splitting it into multiple files improved:

1. **Maintainability**: Easier to navigate and understand specific components
2. **Testability**: Separate files make unit testing easier
3. **Collaboration**: Multiple developers can work on different files simultaneously
4. **Code Organization**: Logical grouping of related functionality

## Final File Structure (Actual Results)

```
tfe/
├── main.go                 # Entry point (21 lines) ✅
├── types.go                # Type definitions (110 lines) ✅
├── styles.go               # Lipgloss styles (36 lines) ✅
├── model.go                # Model initialization & layout (64 lines) ✅
├── update.go               # Event handling (453 lines) ✅
├── view.go                 # View dispatcher (108 lines) ✅
├── render_file_list.go     # File list rendering (284 lines) ✅
├── render_preview.go       # Preview rendering (266 lines) ✅
├── file_operations.go      # File operations & formatting (329 lines) ✅
└── editor.go               # External editor integration (72 lines) ✅

Total: 1,743 lines across 10 files
Original: 1,668 lines in 1 file
```

## Refactoring Phases (Completed)

### Phase 1: Extract Types and Constants ✅
**Goal**: Move all type definitions, constants, and enums to `types.go`

**Result**: `types.go` - 110 lines containing all struct definitions and enums

### Phase 2: Extract Styles ✅
**Goal**: Move all Lipgloss style definitions to `styles.go`

**Result**: `styles.go` - 36 lines of centralized style definitions

### Phase 3: Extract File Operations ✅
**Goal**: Move file system operations and utilities to dedicated files

**Result**:
- `file_operations.go` - 329 lines
- `editor.go` - 72 lines

### Phase 4: Extract Rendering Logic ✅
**Goal**: Split rendering functions into logical groups

**Result**:
- `render_file_list.go` - 284 lines
- `render_preview.go` - 266 lines
- `view.go` - 108 lines

### Phase 5: Extract Update Logic ✅
**Goal**: Move Update() function to its own file

**Result**: `update.go` - 453 lines of event handling

### Phase 6: Extract Model ✅
**Goal**: Organize model initialization and layout functions

**Result**: `model.go` - 64 lines

### Phase 7: Simplify main.go ✅
**Goal**: Reduce main.go to just program entry point

**Result**: `main.go` - 21 lines
```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"os"
	tea "github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea"
)

func main() {
	p := tea.NewProgram(
		initialModel(),
		tea.WithAltScreen(),
		tea.WithMouseCellMotion(),
	)

	if _, err := p.Run(); err != nil {
		fmt.Printf("Error: %v", err)
		os.Exit(1)
	}
}
```

## Testing Strategy

After each refactoring phase:

1. **Build**: Ensure `go build` succeeds
2. **Run**: Test basic functionality (navigate, preview, mouse, keyboard)
3. **Compare**: Verify behavior matches pre-refactor version
4. **Commit**: Create a commit for each phase

## Important Notes

- **Keep all code in the same package** (`package main`) to avoid export issues
- **Maintain exact same functionality** - this is pure refactoring, no feature changes
- **Test thoroughly** after each phase to catch any regressions early
- **Use git** to track changes and enable easy rollback if needed

## Success Criteria - All Met! ✅

✅ All code split into logical files (no single file > 500 lines)
✅ Program builds without errors
✅ All functionality works identically to before refactoring
✅ Code is more readable and maintainable
✅ Each file has a clear, single responsibility

## Completion Summary

**Date Completed**: 2025-10-15
**Total Time**: Approximately 4 hours
**Commits**: Multiple phased commits to main branch
**Testing**: All functionality verified working

The refactoring was completed successfully with all phases tested and committed to the main branch. The codebase is now significantly more maintainable and ready for future development.
