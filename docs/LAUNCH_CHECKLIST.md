### üî¥ Critical Missing (Blockers for v1.0)

#### 1. Copy Files ‚ö†Ô∏è HIGH PRIORITY
**Status:** Not implemented
**Why critical:** Most common file operation after navigation
**Implementation:**
- [ ] Add context menu item: "üìã Copy to..."
- [ ] Input dialog for destination path
- [ ] Progress indicator for large files
- [ ] Error handling (permissions, disk space)
- [ ] F5 conflicts with clipboard - use **Shift+F5** or context menu only

**Estimated Time:** 2-3 hours
**Files:** New `file_copy.go` module, `context_menu.go`, `dialog.go`

#### 2. Rename Files ‚ö†Ô∏è HIGH PRIORITY

**Estimated Time:** 1-2 hours
**Files:** `context_menu.go`, `dialog.go`, `file_operations.go`

#### 3. New File Creation ‚ö†Ô∏è HIGH PRIORITY

- [ ] Input dialog for filename
- [ ] Auto-open in external editor after creation
- [ ] Error handling (permissions, exists)

**Estimated Time:** 1 hour

## Release Process

### 10. GitHub Release Preparation

**Required:**
- [ ] Create GitHub release (v1.0.0)

- [ ] Build binaries for multiple platforms:
  - [ ] Linux (amd64, arm64)
  - [ ] macOS (amd64, arm64)
  - [ ] Windows (amd64) - native if possible
- [ ] Attach binaries to release
- [ ] Create installation script (curl | sh pattern)

**Estimated Time:** 2-3 hours
**Tools:** GoReleaser (automates multi-platform builds)

### 11. Marketing & Launch

**Launch Targets:**
- [ ] Post to r/golang (Show HN style)

Browse files like Midnight Commander, manage prompts like a library, fill variables interactively, and copy rendered results with one keystroke. Works beautifully on desktop AND mobile (Termux) with full touch controls. Perfect for developers working with Claude Code and AI tools anywhere."

**Lead with:**
1. Fillable fields + prompts library (unique!)
2. Mobile/Termux support (rare in TUI file managers!)

**Estimated Time:** 1 hour (writing posts)
