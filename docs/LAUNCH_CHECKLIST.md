## Technical Polish

### 🟡 Nice to Have (Can ship without)

#### 7. Symlink Indicators
**Status:** Not implemented
**Why useful:** Users can see broken/circular symlinks
**Implementation:**
- [ ] Detect symlinks in `loadFiles()`
- [ ] Different icon (🔗) or color
- [ ] Show target in detail view/status bar

**Estimated Time:** 1 hour
**Priority:** Medium (can ship without)

#### 8. File Permissions Indicator
**Status:** Partial (shown in status bar)
**Enhancement:**
- [ ] Show executable flag in detail view
- [ ] Visual indicator for read-only files
- [ ] Color coding for permission levels

**Estimated Time:** 1 hour
**Priority:** Low (nice to have)

#### 9. Binary File Detection Improvements
**Status:** Basic detection exists
**Enhancement:**
- [ ] Better heuristics (check for NULL bytes)
- [ ] Detect more file types (images, videos, PDFs)
- [ ] Offer to open in system app

**Estimated Time:** 1 hour
**Priority:** Low

## Release Process

### 10. GitHub Release Preparation

**Required:**
- [ ] Create GitHub release (v1.0.0)
- [ ] Write release notes (features, usage, installation)
- [ ] Build binaries for multiple platforms:
  - [ ] Linux (amd64, arm64)
  - [ ] macOS (amd64, arm64)
  - [ ] Windows (amd64) - native if possible
- [ ] Attach binaries to release
- [ ] Create installation script (curl | sh pattern)

**Estimated Time:** 2-3 hours
**Tools:** GoReleaser (automates multi-platform builds)

### 11. Marketing & Launch

**Launch Targets:**
- [ ] Post to r/golang (Show HN style)
- [ ] Post to r/commandline
- [ ] Post to r/unixporn (with nice screenshots!)
- [ ] Hacker News (Show HN: TFE - Terminal File Explorer with AI Prompts)
- [ ] lobste.rs
- [ ] Tweet/Mastodon announcement
- [ ] Add to awesome-tui lists

**Marketing Angle:**
> "TFE isn't just another file manager - it's the first terminal file explorer built for the AI era. Browse files like Midnight Commander, manage prompts like a library, fill variables interactively, and copy rendered results with one keystroke. Works beautifully on desktop AND mobile (Termux) with full touch controls. Perfect for developers working with Claude Code and AI tools anywhere."

**Lead with:**
1. Fillable fields + prompts library (unique!)
2. Mobile/Termux support (rare in TUI file managers!)

**Estimated Time:** 1 hour (writing posts)
