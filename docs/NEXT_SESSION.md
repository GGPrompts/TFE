### Session: 2025-10-16 (update.go Refactoring - Phase 9)

**Refactoring:** Split update.go (1145 lines) into 3 focused modules

**Changes:**
1. **update.go** (1145 ‚Üí 111 lines) - Main dispatcher only
   - Init(), Update() dispatcher, WindowSizeMsg, spinner, editor/command finished handlers
   - Helper functions: isSpecialKey(), cleanBracketedPaste(), isBracketedPasteMarker()
   - Added tree items cache update at start of Update()

2. **update_keyboard.go** (714 lines) - All keyboard event handling
   - handleKeyEvent() main handler
   - Preview mode keys, dialog input, context menu navigation
   - Command prompt handling, file browser keys (F1-F10, navigation, display modes)
   - Fixed special key detection and bracketed paste filtering

3. **update_mouse.go** (470 lines) - All mouse event handling
   - handleMouseEvent() main handler
   - Fixed tree view mouse calculations (now uses m.treeItems in tree mode)
   - Left/right click, double-click detection, context menu, scrolling
   - Updated maxVisible calculations for 2-line status bar

**Bug Fixes:**
- Command line input: Special keys no longer type literally
- Bracketed paste: No more `[` and `]` markers
- Tree view mouse: Clicks now work correctly when folders are expanded
- Type column: Now shows descriptive types (100+ file extension mappings)
- Footer: Now two lines to prevent filename truncation

**CLAUDE.md:** Updated with Phase 9 refactoring details

## Next Priorities

### Option 1: Search Functionality
Add file/directory search capabilities:
- Search by name (fuzzy matching)
- Filter current directory
- Recursive search option
- Search results view mode

### Option 2: Copy/Move Operations
Extend file operations beyond create/delete:
- F5: Copy file (currently just copies path)
- F6: Move/rename file (currently favorites toggle - may need new key)
- Multi-select support (Space to mark, operations on marked files)
- Progress indicators for large operations

### Option 3: Performance Optimizations
Optimize for large directories:
- Lazy loading for directories with thousands of files
- Virtual scrolling in grid/list views
- Background preview loading
- Preview caching improvements

### Option 4: UX Polish
Small but impactful improvements:
- Breadcrumb navigation in header
- File/folder size summaries in detail view
- Recent files/folders history
- Quick jump to letter (type 'a' to jump to first file starting with 'a')

## Quick Start for Next Session

Pick a priority and dive in, or explore new ideas in BACKLOG.md first.

For search functionality:
```
Hi! Let's add search functionality to TFE. I'd like to:
1. Add file/directory name search with fuzzy matching
2. Show search results in a filtered view
3. Use a keyboard shortcut to trigger search (maybe Ctrl+F or /)
4. Allow clearing search to return to normal view

What do you think would be the best approach?
```

For copy/move operations:
```
Hi! Let's extend TFE's file operations with copy and move functionality.
Currently F5 copies the path, but we need actual file copying.
What key bindings would work best? Should we repurpose existing keys or add new ones?
```

Good luck with the next feature! üöÄ
