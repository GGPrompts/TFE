# Next Session: Fix Markdown Preview Scrolling Performance

## Problem Statement

Markdown files with ASCII art / box formatting (like CLAUDE.md, README.md) have extremely laggy scrolling in full-screen preview mode, while simpler markdown files scroll smoothly. The lag is NOT related to file length - some very long files are fine while others with box art are choppy.

## Root Cause Analysis (Credit: OpenAI Codex)

**The Issue:**
- Markdown previews never hit the cache
- In `file_operations.go:708-717`, the markdown branch returns immediately after loading the file
- This skips the `populatePreviewCache()` call
- Result: `render_preview.go:141-193` rebuilds a Glamour renderer and re-renders the **entire document on every frame**
- Glamour walks every rune even for simple monospace art, making this very expensive
- Even worse: when toggling to full-screen, the width changes but cache is never repopulated
- Width mismatch forces re-running Glamour on every redraw ‚Üí laggy scrolling

## Code Locations

**file_operations.go:**
- Lines 708-717: Markdown loading branch that returns early, skipping cache population
- Need to ensure `populatePreviewCache()` is called after markdown load

**render_preview.go:**
- Lines 141-193: Glamour renderer recreation on every frame (performance hotspot)
- Should be using cached content instead

**Cache-related functions:**
- `populatePreviewCache()`: Needs to be called after markdown load
- Cache invalidation on view mode switch (width changes)

## Required Fixes

### Fix 1: Always Cache Markdown Previews
After loading markdown content in `file_operations.go`, ensure `populatePreviewCache()` is called so the Glamour-rendered output is cached once (it already stores results in `cachedRenderedContent`).

**Current problematic code (~line 708-717):**
```go
// Markdown branch returns early - skips populatePreviewCache()
if isMarkdown {
    // ... render with Glamour
    return  // ‚Üê This is the problem!
}
```

**Solution:** Don't return early, let it fall through to `populatePreviewCache()`

### Fix 2: Repopulate Cache on View Mode Changes
When switching between dual-pane and full-screen preview modes, the width changes. Recompute the cache with the new width.

**Locations to add cache repopulation:**
1. After `m.viewMode = viewFullPreview` (in update_keyboard.go)
2. When returning to split view from full-screen
3. Anywhere the preview width changes

**Pseudocode:**
```go
m.viewMode = viewFullPreview
m.calculateLayout()  // Updates widths
m.populatePreviewCache()  // Refresh cache with new width
```

### Fix 3: (Optional Follow-up) Optimize Glamour Renderer
Create the Glamour renderer once per width instead of inside the render loop. However, fixes 1 and 2 should eliminate the stutter on their own.

## Testing Checklist

After implementing fixes, test with:
- [ ] CLAUDE.md (has box art project structure)
- [ ] README.md (has various formatting)
- [ ] A simple markdown file (should still work smoothly)
- [ ] Toggle between dual-pane and full-screen preview
- [ ] Scroll up and down rapidly with arrow keys and mouse wheel
- [ ] Verify no performance regression in non-markdown files

## Expected Outcome

- Smooth scrolling in markdown previews (including ASCII art heavy files)
- Cache is populated once after loading markdown
- Cache is refreshed when view mode / width changes
- No repeated Glamour re-renders on every frame

## Implementation Approach

1. Read `file_operations.go` around lines 690-720
2. Identify the markdown early return
3. Refactor to ensure `populatePreviewCache()` is called
4. Find all view mode switches in `update_keyboard.go`
5. Add `m.populatePreviewCache()` calls after mode changes
6. Build and test with CLAUDE.md and README.md
7. Verify performance improvement

## Quick Start Prompt

```
Hi! There's a performance issue with markdown preview scrolling. Files with ASCII
art (like CLAUDE.md) are very laggy while scrolling.

The root cause (identified by Codex): markdown previews skip populatePreviewCache()
due to an early return in file_operations.go around line 708-717. This causes
Glamour to re-render the entire document on every frame.

Also, when switching view modes, the cache width changes but isn't repopulated.

Can you:
1. Fix the markdown loading to call populatePreviewCache()
2. Add cache repopulation when view modes change (dual-pane ‚Üî full-screen)
3. Test with CLAUDE.md to verify smooth scrolling

The relevant files are file_operations.go (lines 690-720) and update_keyboard.go
(view mode switches).
