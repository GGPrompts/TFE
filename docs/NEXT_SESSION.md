## üé® Marketing Angles

### Unique Selling Points:
1. **Prompts Library** - First file manager with built-in AI prompt management
   - Fillable `{{VARIABLES}}` with file picker
   - Auto-shows `~/.prompts/` and `~/.claude/` globally
   - Perfect for AI-assisted development

2. **Image Support in Terminal** - View and edit images without leaving the CLI
   - viu/timg/chafa for viewing
   - textual-paint for editing (MS Paint in terminal!)

3. **Educational Design** - Keyboard shortcuts taught through UI
   - F1 help always available
   - Context menu shows all actions
   - Command prompt with history

4. **Hybrid Approach** - Best of both worlds
   - Fast native preview for text/markdown
   - External editor integration (micro/nano/vim)
   - TUI tool launcher (lazygit, lazydocker, etc.)

### Taglines to Test:
- "TFE: The file manager that teaches you Linux"
- "Midnight Commander meets modern TUI design"
- "File management + AI prompts in your terminal"
- "Built for Claude Code users, perfect for everyone"

## üöÄ Post-Launch Features (v1.1+)

Save these for after v1.0 ships:

### v1.1 - Educational Features (2-3 weeks)
**Command Pre-filling** - Revolutionary educational feature
- Instead of executing operations, pre-fill command line
- Users learn Linux commands while using TFE
- Press Enter to execute, Esc to cancel, or edit the command
- Examples:
  - Rename ‚Üí Pre-fills `mv 'old.txt' '‚ñà'`
  - Copy ‚Üí Pre-fills `cp -r 'folder' '‚ñà'`
  - Delete ‚Üí Pre-fills `rm -rf 'file.txt'` (shows what F8 does!)
- **Marketing:** "The File Manager That Teaches You Linux"
- Platform-aware templates (GNU vs BSD, WSL differences)

### v1.2 - Context Visualizer (2-3 weeks)
**Claude Code Integration** - Unique differentiator
- Press Ctrl+K to analyze Claude Code context
- Show files with token estimates (4 chars = 1 token)
- Visual indicators: ‚úÖ Included, ‚ùå Excluded, ‚ö†Ô∏è Too large
- Display total: "45K / 200K tokens (22%)"
- Parse .gitignore and .claudeignore
- Suggest files to exclude for optimization
- **Marketing:** "See what Claude Code sees from your directory"

### v1.3 - Productivity Boost (1-2 weeks)
- Multi-select operations (Space to select, batch operations)
- Archive operations (extract/create .zip, .tar.gz, .tar.bz2)

## üéì Lessons Learned This Session

**What Went Well:**
- Modular architecture made adding features easy (context_menu.go, file_operations.go, etc.)
- Dialog system reuse (input/confirm dialogs work perfectly)
- User feedback drove mouse toggle improvement (border removal suggestion)
- External tool integration was straightforward (viu, textual-paint)

**Challenges Overcome:**
- WSL cmd.exe browser opening quirk (needed empty "" title)
- Mouse toggle in dual-pane mode (terminal selection limitations)
- pipx/Pillow installation on laptop (missing JPEG dev headers)

**Process Improvements:**
- Always read file before Write tool (hit this error with NEXT_SESSION.md)
- Todo list tracking works great for complex sessions
- User testing immediately after implementation catches UX issues
