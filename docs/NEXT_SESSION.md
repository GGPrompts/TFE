## Prompt to Start Next Session

```
Hi! I'm back to continue working on TFE.

Last session we completed Phase 1 (F7/F8 file operations with dialog system) and set up documentation management rules. Everything is in CHANGELOG.md v0.4.0.

What should we work on next? Here are some options:

1. **Phase 2: Code Quality** - Refactor update.go (991 lines), improve error handling
2. **Search/Filter** - Quick file search within current directory (user-requested)
3. **Menu Bar** - DEFERRED to BACKLOG.md (too complex for now, needs mouse positioning audit)
4. **Something else** - Check PLAN.md or BACKLOG.md for ideas

Please review the current status and suggest what makes sense to prioritize next.
```

## Quick Reference

**Documentation Structure:**
- `PLAN.md` - Current roadmap (Phase 2-5)
- `BACKLOG.md` - Ideas not ready for PLAN.md yet
- `CHANGELOG.md` - v0.4.0 released today
- `CLAUDE.md` - Architecture guide + doc management rules

**Key Files:**
- `dialog.go` - NEW! Dialog rendering system
- `file_operations.go` - createDirectory(), deleteFileOrDir(), setStatusMessage()
- `update.go` - F7/F8 handlers + dialog event handling
- `view.go` - Dialog overlay rendering + status messages
- `context_menu.go` - "New Folder" and "Delete" menu items

**Current Line Counts:**
- All docs are within limits ‚úÖ
- PLAN.md: 339/400 lines
- CHANGELOG.md: 254/300 lines
- CLAUDE.md: 408/500 lines

## Known Issues

1. ‚ö†Ô∏è **Menu bar idea deferred** - Would break mouse positioning in ~8+ locations (see BACKLOG.md)
2. üìù **update.go is large** - 991 lines, Phase 2 includes refactoring
3. üîç **No search yet** - Can't filter files in current directory

## Testing Notes

If you want to test F7/F8 before continuing:
```bash
cd /home/matt/TFE
./tfe
# Press F7 to create a directory
# Press F8 to delete a file/folder
# Right-click for context menu with "New Folder" and "Delete"
```

**Last Updated:** 2025-10-16
**Next Priority:** TBD - discuss with user at start of next session
