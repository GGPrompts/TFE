**Estimated time:** 2 days

### Coverage Breakdown (Current)

| Module | Current Coverage | Priority | Target |
|--------|------------------|----------|--------|
| `favorites.go` | 86-100% | âœ… Done | - |
| `helpers.go` | 75-100% | âœ… Good | - |

### Test Writing Plan

#### Phase 1: File Operations (Day 1, AM)
**Target:** Add 15% coverage (8.7% â†’ 23.7%)

Create comprehensive `file_operations_test.go` additions:
```go
// Priority functions to test:
- TestLoadFiles() - directory reading
- TestLoadPreview() - file content loading
- TestGetFileIcon() - icon selection
- TestLoadSubdirFiles() - tree view expansion
- TestIsImageFile() / TestIsHTMLFile() / TestIsBrowserFile()
```

**Estimated:** 3-4 hours, +15 tests

#### Phase 2: Editor & Browser Integration (Day 1, PM)
**Target:** Add 10% coverage (23.7% â†’ 33.7%)

Create `editor_test.go`:
```go
// Core editor functions:
- TestEditorAvailable() - check for nano, vim, etc.
- TestGetAvailableEditor() - priority selection
- TestGetAvailableBrowser() - platform detection
- TestIsWSL() - WSL detection
- TestIsImageFile() - file type detection
- TestGetAvailableImageViewer() - viu/timg/chafa
```

**Estimated:** 2-3 hours, +12 tests

#### Phase 3: Command Execution (Day 2, AM)
**Target:** Add 5% coverage (33.7% â†’ 38.7%)

Create `command_test.go`:
```go
// Command system tests:
- TestShellQuote() - command sanitization
- TestAddToHistory() - command history
- TestGetPreviousCommand() / TestGetNextCommand()
```

**Estimated:** 2 hours, +8 tests

#### Phase 4: Trash & Context Menu (Day 2, PM)
**Target:** Add 3% coverage (38.7% â†’ 41.7%)

Expand `trash_test.go` and create `context_menu_test.go`:
```go
// Trash operations:
- TestMoveToTrash() - trash file movement
- TestRestoreFromTrash() - restoration
- TestEmptyTrash() - permanent deletion
- TestGetTrashPath() - path calculation

// Context menu:
- TestGetContextMenuItems() - menu generation
- TestIsExecutableFile() - file permissions
```

**Estimated:** 2-3 hours, +10 tests

## ðŸŸ¢ Priority 3: Remaining Security Items

### Items from Audit Report

1. **Symlink Safety Checks** (1 hour)
   - Add `os.Lstat()` instead of `os.Stat()` in file operations
   - Detect symlinks and warn users
   - Test symlink following behavior

2. **Path Traversal Validation** (1 hour)
   - Add `filepath.Clean()` to all path operations
   - Validate paths stay within intended boundaries
   - Test with `../` sequences

3. **Dependency Updates** (15 minutes)
   ```bash
   go get github.com/alecthomas/chroma/v2@latest
   go mod tidy
   ```

4. **Input Validation Helpers** (30 minutes)
   - Create `security.go` module with validation functions
   - Add dangerous pattern detection for commands
   - Centralize security checks

## Notes

### Why 40% Coverage?
- Covers all critical paths (file I/O, command execution)
- Industry standard for CLI tools
- Prevents regressions in core functionality
- Security-critical code fully tested

### What's NOT Being Tested?
- UI rendering functions (difficult to test in TUI)
- Full integration tests (can be added later)
- Platform-specific edge cases (covered by manual testing)

### After Launch (v1.1+)
- Increase coverage to 60%
- Add integration tests
- Add fuzzing tests for security
- Performance benchmarks
- Security scanning in CI/CD

---

## Current Blockers

**NONE!** ðŸŽ‰

You have everything you need to get to 40% coverage and launch. The critical security fixes are done, the documentation is excellent, and the test infrastructure is in place.

**Next Step:** Start writing tests for `file_operations.go` functions. That's the biggest coverage win.
