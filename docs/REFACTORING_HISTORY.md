# TFE Refactoring History

This document chronicles the systematic refactoring that transformed TFE from a monolithic single-file application to a well-organized modular architecture.

## Overview

The modular architecture was achieved through a systematic refactoring process that reduced `main.go` from 1668 lines to just 21 lines, distributing functionality across focused modules.

## Refactoring Timeline

### Original State
- **Single `main.go` file**: 1668 lines
- All functionality in one file: UI, file operations, rendering, state management
- Difficult to navigate, test, and maintain

### Phase 1-4: Foundation Extraction
**Commit:** 9befa48

Extracted core components:
- `types.go` - Type definitions and structs
- `styles.go` - Lipgloss style definitions
- `file_operations.go` - File system operations
- `editor.go` - External editor integration

**Impact:** Separated data structures and external integrations from UI logic

### Phase 5: File List Rendering
**Commit:** 3d992c6

Extracted rendering functions:
- `render_file_list.go` - All file list view rendering (List, Grid, Detail, Tree)
- Isolated view-specific logic from main application flow

**Impact:** Rendering concerns separated from business logic

### Phase 6: Preview Rendering
**Commit:** 49d6ece

Extracted preview system:
- `render_preview.go` - Preview pane and full-screen preview rendering
- `view.go` - View dispatcher and single-pane rendering

**Impact:** Complete separation of rendering pipeline

### Phase 7: Update Logic Extraction
**Commit:** 03efd5c

Extracted application lifecycle:
- `update.go` - Update dispatcher, Init(), event handling
- Centralized message routing

**Impact:** Clean separation of event handling from rendering

### Phase 8: Model Initialization
**Commit:** 68d5a87

Extracted model management:
- `model.go` - Model initialization and layout calculations
- Separated initialization concerns from update logic

**Impact:** Clear boundary between setup and runtime behavior

### Phase 9: Update Logic Split (Final Major Refactor)

Split the massive `update.go` (1145 lines) into three focused files:
- `update.go` (111 lines) - Message dispatcher only
- `update_keyboard.go` (714 lines) - All keyboard event handling
- `update_mouse.go` (383 lines) - All mouse event handling

**Impact:** Each input method has its own file, making it easy to add new shortcuts or mouse interactions

### Final Result

- **main.go**: 21 lines (entry point only) ✅
- **All modules**: Under 800 lines each ✅
- **Total modules**: 17 focused files
- **Clear separation**: Each file has single, well-defined responsibility

## Architecture Benefits Realized

1. **Maintainability**: Easy to locate and modify specific functionality
2. **Readability**: Each file is focused and easier to understand
3. **Collaboration**: Multiple developers can work on different modules without conflicts
4. **Testing**: Isolated modules are easier to unit test
5. **Scalability**: New features can be added without cluttering existing code
6. **IDE Support**: Code navigation and search work better with smaller files

## Lessons Learned

### What Worked Well
- **Systematic approach**: Tackled one concern at a time (rendering, then updates, then input)
- **Clear naming**: File names immediately convey their purpose
- **Single responsibility**: Each module does one thing and does it well
- **Progressive refinement**: Multiple passes to get the organization right

### Challenges Overcome
- **State sharing**: Needed to carefully design which state lives where
- **Function dependencies**: Some functions needed to be moved together
- **Import cycles**: Keeping everything in `package main` avoided this issue
- **Testing during refactor**: Continuous manual testing ensured no breakage

## Module Growth Over Time

Additional modules added post-refactoring:
- `command.go` - Command prompt system
- `dialog.go` - Input/confirmation dialogs
- `context_menu.go` - Right-click menus
- `favorites.go` - Bookmarks system
- `helpers.go` - Utility functions
- `trash.go` - Trash/recycle bin
- `prompt_parser.go` - Prompt template parsing
- `fuzzy_search.go` - Fuzzy file search
- `menu.go` - Menu bar rendering

Each new module followed the established architectural patterns.

## Metrics

**Before Refactoring:**
- Files: 1
- Lines: 1,668
- Largest function: ~200 lines
- Test coverage: 0%

**After Refactoring:**
- Files: 17
- Total lines: ~15,000 (includes new features)
- Largest file: 714 lines (update_keyboard.go)
- Largest function: ~100 lines
- Architecture: Modular, testable, maintainable

## Maintaining the Architecture

**Golden Rules:**
1. Never add complex logic to `main.go`
2. Keep modules under 800 lines (target: <500)
3. Extract new modules when functionality becomes substantial
4. Update CLAUDE.md when creating new modules
5. Follow the decision tree for where new code belongs

**This architecture took significant effort to establish - let's maintain it!** 🏗️
