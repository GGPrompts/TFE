## Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1: Shortest Path (2-3 hours)
Add PM to context menu, keep it standalone

**Read:** QUICK_REFERENCE.md "Adding Context Menu Item"
**Files:** context_menu.go only
**Result:** Right-click in TFE â†’ "ðŸ“‹ Project Manager" launches PM

---

### Phase 2: Better Integration (4-6 hours additional)
Add PM as toggleable view mode

**Read:** CODE_PATTERNS.md Patterns #3-4
**Files:** types.go, update_keyboard.go, view.go, project_manager.go (NEW)
**Result:** Ctrl+Shift+P toggles between file browser and PM

---

### Phase 3: Full Integration (8-12 hours additional)
PM as side panel like dual-pane mode

**Read:** EXPLORATION_ANALYSIS.md complete
**Files:** model.go, styles.go, render_file_list.go + all from Phase 2
**Result:** Files and projects visible simultaneously

---

## Key Insights from Analysis

1. **TFE is Modular** - 14 focused files, each with single responsibility
2. **Extension Points Exist** - Multiple clean ways to add PM without hacking
3. **Patterns Are Proven** - lazygit, lazydocker already integrated successfully
4. **Terminal State Handled** - No ANSI code wrestling needed
5. **Messaging System** - Bubbletea message-passing is extensible

---

## Pre-Implementation Checklist

Before you start coding:

- [ ] Your PM builds as standalone binary
- [ ] Your PM accepts directory context
- [ ] Your PM uses Bubbletea or similar TUI framework
- [ ] You've read TFE_INTEGRATION_SUMMARY.md
- [ ] You've decided on integration level (1, 2, or 3)
- [ ] You understand TFE's view mode pattern
- [ ] You've reviewed relevant CODE_PATTERNS.md sections

---

## Success Checklist

### After Implementation

- [ ] PM launches from TFE context menu
- [ ] PM exits cleanly without terminal corruption
- [ ] File list refreshes when PM closes
- [ ] No errors in TFE functionality
- [ ] Keyboard shortcuts don't conflict
- [ ] Status messages show on completion
- [ ] Performance is responsive
